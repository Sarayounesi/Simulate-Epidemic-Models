This repository contains solutions for the assignment focused on simulating epidemic models on network models.

Assignment Tasks
1. 
Simulate Two Epidemic Models on Two Network Models
•  Four Simulation Scenarios: Conduct simulations for two epidemic models on two different network models.

•  Example: SIRS epidemic model on Barabási–Albert (BA) network model.

1. 
Epidemic Models
•  SIRS Model: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible model.

•  Other Model: Choose another epidemic model for simulation.

1. 
Network Models
•  Barabási–Albert (BA) Network: Scale-free network model.

•  Other Network Model: Choose another network model for simulation.

1. 
Simulation Scenarios
•  Conduct simulations for each combination of epidemic and network models.

•  Analyze the spread and dynamics of the epidemic in each scenario.
